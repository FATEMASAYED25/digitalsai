                    in a women list and send them women shoes offers. and the others in men list, and get different

                <p>Let’s consider what you need to have in place to make this work. First, you will need to know the
                    individual customer’s identity. You’ll need web tracking in place to capture the specific product
                    information and the purchase stage (did the customer complete checkout or not)? You’ll need to store
                    this information somewhere, perhaps in eCommerce software. Finally, you will need a transactional
                    email system to act on this data, so you can send personalized, timely emails to the user.</p>

                <h3>2/avoid sending spam emailes</h3>
                <p>spam is email that you don't want and didn't ask for </p>
                <p>say,You receive a call from a company that is offering you a list of 10,000 real email addresses for
                    a few hundred dollars. You purchase the list and then email the customers asking if they want to
                    subscribe to your email newsletter. this called spam emails if you do that your business may get the
                    legal penalties:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>your internet service provider can terminate your internet service</li>
                    <li>your website hosting company can shut down your website </li>
                    <li>you can lose customers.</li>
                    <li>get backlisted this mean that the target mail server refuses to accept your messages so they
                        naver get delivered.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <a target="_blank"

                </p>




                <h3>3/use responsive email templates</h3>
                <p>
                    Now you’ve got your database, let’s think about the actual emails. Email templates allow you to
                    create a design that matches your brand. You can reuse your template again and again, for similar
                    email campaigns.

                    Keep in mind that many people read email on their mobiles, so be sure yours are mobile-friendly.
                    Many email marketing tools allow you to preview your email on different devices before you send.
                    Another great feature to know about is the ability to schedule when your email goes out. You can
                    send the email immediately, or choose a later day and time.
                </p>
                <p>With our customizable templates, there’s no need to start your email from scratch. Choose a layout
                    that fits the message you want to get across,</p>

                <h3>4/use Confirmed opt-in process (confirmed subscription email)</h3>
                <div class="content-king">
                    <div class="imgo"><img src="../imgs/sumo-convert .png"></div>
                    <div class="contento">
                        <p> which works as follow :</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The potential customer gives their name and email address on a contact form</li>
                            <li>Company sends the potential customer an email to confirm their email address </li>
                            <li>Customer opens the email and confirms their email address </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>The confirmed opt-in process helps protect your database against fake email address, ensure
                            that your subscribers give you consent to send them email communication and to achieve
                            higher open rates, lower bounce rates and unsubscribes.</p>

                <p> in order to get customers to read your newsletter, you first have to get them to open the email.
                    It’s all about making a good first impression here. Think about what customers see when they glance
                    at their inbox. Will your email make them want to open it?

                    The two things they’ll see, are your business name in the “From” field, and the subject line of your
                    email.

                    Be sure to use a name and email address in your “From” field that clearly identifies your business.
                    People are more likely to open an email, from someone they recognise and trust. The subject line of
                    your email can make or break your campaign. An effective subject line will compel people to open it.
                    A poorly composed subject line might mean your email gets deleted or trapped in spam filters.

                    Keep your subject line short and simple—ideally under ten words. Try to capture the most valuable
                    and relevant information contained in the email.

                    When possible, personalise or localise the subject line. For example: “Jane, is your pup the
                    healthiest in London?”

                    It’s best to avoid words like “free,” “percent off,” “reminder,” and “specials,” as well as pound
                    (£) symbols and exclamation points. These are all known to trigger spam filters.</p>
                <p>

                    pest praactice here say that ,<br>
                    you have cars store and begain to launch a new product like (clean car), then you plan for making an
                    event to spread awareness
                    about your new products and you offer free burgers for visitors .<br>
                    What do you think, wich subject line is more effective and attractive?<br>
                <p>

                    1/We have new CleanCars available!<br>
                    2/Join us to celebrate the new CleanCar with burgers and brews on Saturday, June 30th!<br>
                    3/Join us for free burgers and brews on Saturday, June 30th!<br>
                </p>

                <p>what about the first one?<br>
                    of course not, because it is confused,is not personalize which don't speaking with a customer , Free
                    from free an event date and your burgers offer
                </p>

                <p>what about the secound one?<br>
                    may be ,it is personalize, announce for a new product and the date of event and free food offer but
                    it is very long .
                </p>

                <p>what about the third one?<br>
                    yes of course , The third subject line works best. It mentions the date of the event (June 30th) and
                    provides an incentive for customers (everyone loves free food and drinks)! Note that it doesn’t
                    mention the new line (CleanCar). Remember that is our goal to get people to the event, so our
                    subject line should be aligned with that, and we can use the email body to talk about CleanCar. The
                    fourth subject line is a bit too long and hard to read. Remember you want to get to the point
                    quickly in a subject line because subject lines can be cut off - especially on mobile phones.
                </p>



                <p>Pre-header.<br>
                    This is the light grey “pre-header” text that may displayed in my inbox. Note that this is the first
                    text that appears in the email. The prompt to add the sender to an address book. When customers do
                    this, it ensures that the emails from that sender are not marked as spam or filtered into a
                    “Promotions/Ad” category. This greatly increases the chance that your emails get read. There is also
                    a link to “view in web browser,” which links to an HTML version of the email.</p>
                <div class="sorty"><img src="../imgs/Inbox2.png"></div>

                <h3>6/email body</h3>

                <p>
                    Now, you’ve captured your customers’ attention, and they’ve opened your email. Congratulations!
                    That’s half the battle.
                    now it is time for your message in email body so there are some essential elements to include them
                    in your email body to be effective
                    and professional email :</p>

                <h4>A/business logo</h4>
                <p> put your business logo on the top of email, This helps subscribers quickly identify the brand.
                    Eye-tracking studies have found that people automatically look for logos in the upper left-hand side
                    of emails.</p>

                <h4>B/images</h4>
                <p>use attractive imags tray to explain what you want by images and take professional photos for your
                    products.</p>

                <h4>C/paragraphs</h4>
                <p>
                    At this point, keep in mind how busy your customers are, and how many other emails they get every
                    day. Even if you’ve crafted the most intriguing message possible, they’ll likely just scan it. So
                    keep your content concise, and get right to the point.
                    Your paragraphs should be short—maybe one to three sentences, and keep them focused on a single
                    idea.<br>
                    You can always link to longer articles and additional information, on your website.<br>
                    Make your writing as persuasive and engaging as possible. And use the right tone of voice for your
                    audience. You want to have consistency across your brand, but email newsletters offer opportunities
                    to be a bit more casual in tone.<br>
                    Use bold text and design, to highlight important offers and content

                </p>

                <h3>7/call to action</h3>
                <p>
                    Links in your email should include calls to action.
                    your call to action is the most important part of your email
                    make sure it is clear, singular you should put only one of these per email <br>
                    , descriptive it should describe the action you want the customer to take <br>
                    make a call to action like button have a square or rectangle shape and colorful background
                    Encourage recipients to click through, to offers on your website.
                    For example, a link could say something like “Click here to save 25 percent off your next order of
                    all-natural cat chow”. Or maybe “Click here for free shipping on orders over £50.”
                </p>

                <h4>
                    So remember: Take the time to craft an email, Providing an easy way for users to opt out of
                    subscription, put strong subject line. Write concise content with a fun and engaging tone. And
                    include helpful links that will improve your customer experience, and possibly lead to increased
                    sales.
                    when a person clicks a link within the email, they’ll “land” on a relevant web page. You wouldn’t
                    want someone to click a link to learn about a specific product and end up the hompage, right?
                    Your email campaigns will be more successful if you send visitors directly to the page they want to
                    see, so they can learn about the product, and maybe buy it!
                </h4>



                <h3 id="how-to-use-email-marketing-a/b-testing?">9/use A/B testing </h3>
                <p>You can test any of the parts of an email. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>From name</li>
                    <li>Subject line</li>
                    <li>Preheader</li>
                    <li>Content (images, copy, or call-to-action)</li>
                    <li>Send time, date, or day</li>
                </ul>

                <p>

                    A/B testing is when you create two versions of an email to see which one performs better. You can
                    use this technique to test different email approaches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s say you are sending an email announcing a new product, but you’re not sure what subject line
                    to use. You can send half of your customers, Version A of the subject line, and the other half
                    Version B.

                    Then, look at which email had a higher “open rate”. That is the measure of how many people open your
                    emails, compared to how many emails were delivered. Whichever version had a higher open rate, wins!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use A/B testing to test different subject lines, frequency, content and images. You could
                    try sending emails on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Or, try sending emails weekly and monthly. See what
                    your audience seems to prefer, and then adjust. Keep in mind, that you don’t want to overwhelm
                    people by sending them too many emails. You should always provide the option for people to receive
                    fewer emails, such as a monthly digest. That way they don’t unsubscribe, simply because they want to
                    hear from you less often. Be sure to choose—or create— specific landing pages for your email
                    campaigns. A landing page is the first page a person sees when they arrive at your website.
                    That way, when a person clicks a link within the email, they’ll “land” on a relevant web page. You
                    wouldn’t want someone to click a link to learn about a specific product and end up the homepage,
                    right?

                    Your email campaigns will be more successful if you send visitors directly to the page they want to
                    see, so they can learn about the product, and maybe buy it!

                <h3 id="email-marketing-campaigns-analyzing">10/track what people do when they receive your email</h3>
                <p>
                    An email marketing tool can even be used to track what people do when they receive it.

                    You might find that most of your customers open their email first thing Monday mornings, or, during
                    lunch on Friday. You can then use your email service to record those preferences and send future
                    emails at more relevant times. Email marketing services also track who clicks the links in your
                    email. These links typically go to pages on your website. You can then track what those people do,
                    once they’re on your site. Like, whether they read an article, or make a purchase. As you learn
                    about your customers’ behaviour, you can then deliver more personalised content.
                    By targeting each group with a personalised email, you increase the chances that they will not only
                    read your email, but also click through to visit your website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this step we will explore the benefits associated with understanding email performance, as well
                    as cover common metrics that can provide insights to help you optimise future campaigns.
                    Let’s take a look at five useful email marketing metrics:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> An email campaign Open Rate: is simply the ratio of people who’ve actively opened the email vs.
                        the total number of people who received it. This is useful for understanding the effectiveness
                        of your email subject line. For example, if a subject line of ‘Things We Love About Our Pets’
                        receives a higher open rate than an email titled ‘Discounts and Offers on Pet Food’, this tells
                        you your audience favours emails that give them insight into life as a pet owner, rather than
                        promotional content. Once you know how many people opened the email, take a look at......</li>
                    <li>the Click Through Rate, or CTR.how many people clicked the various links within your email and
                        gone through to your website This offers a top level view of the success of the individual email
                        campaign, and gives you the percentage of people that clicked on links to your website from
                        every email that was opened if a clicks are low means you're not offering enough value or your
                        cta isn't clear .</li>
                    <li> the Conversion Rate would show how many people you sent the email to, performed a specific
                        action on your website or ended up registering for the event.<br>
                        the convertion rate is typically the number of recipients who go on to take an action divided by
                        the number of emails successfully delivered.<br>
                        one way to trace conversions is through google analytics <br>
                        to use google analytics to trace your email campaigns you will have to put google analytices
                        tags within your emails and also include a snippet of code on relevant webpage this allows
                        google analytics to aggregate this information and track the percentages of users who complete
                        the full path from email to purchase

                        <p>Sometimes, when you send emails they ‘bounce’ back:</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Bounce Rate is the percentage of emails that could not be delivered to subscribers and were
                        sent back. There are two kinds of bounces to be aware of:
                        Soft Bounces: These are rejected due to a full inbox or size limit restriction on your
                        audience's email server,server is down when you send the message,filtered as spam.<br>
                        Hard Bounces: Your emails are blocked or the address you are using is incorrect.it's important
                        to remove adresses associated with hard bounces your email list.<br>
                        since sending large amounts of email to
                        invalid email addresses can flag you as a spammer tray to keep your soft and hard bounce rates
                        low</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="sorty"><img src="../imgs/email analytics.jpg"></div>
                <p>
                    saving Your time and effort for your next campaign. Looking at the metrics and the story they tell
                    will help you understand what’s working and what isn’t. The next step is to adjust any future
                    campaigns accordingly, whether that be to refine the subject lines, review the type of content
                    published, or clean up your subscribers list.
