                <h2>online Advertising</h2>
                <p>
                we do lots more on the Internet. We read news, check sports scores, browse recipes,check our emailes , watch videos and generally browse lots and lots of interesting content across the web.
                Alongside all of this content you might see ads. This is called display advertising.
                </p>
                <p>
                Display ads appear everywhere online, and come in many formats like text, images, video, and ads you can click on and interact with.
                They can be a great way to get your message out there and you’re able to choose the people you want to see your ads, and the websites and pages you’d like them to appear on.
                </p>
                <div class="content-king">

                    <div class="imgo"><img src="../imgs\16544.jpg"></div>
                    <div class="contento">
                <p>
                A simple way to break down what you want to achieve with display advertising is to think about the different steps of the customer journey as a funnel. The widest part at the top is awareness.
                </p>
                <p>
                So if building awareness of your business is a goal, you’ll want to target a broad audience and use adverts that make a great first impression. This is a good time to think about what might catch someone’s attention - remember, they’re not actively searching for you when your adverts show up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point, you might narrow down your audience a bit more to include people who have been to your site before, or maybe people who are really interested in the products and services you offer
                at this stage in the funnel is all about shaping people’s opinions of you, and making sure that they remember you in the future when they want what you’re selling.
                So if this is one of your goals, you can create new display advertising campaigns that use messaging to reinforce your competitive advantages and really highlight the benefits of whatever product or service you offer
                
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last step in the sales funnel is the purchase, you could talk about how many subscribers you have, or use testimonials from happy customers
               . If your ultimate goal is to get people to become paying customers, you need to focus on conversion. For example, you can use adverts with special offers 
                Your retargeting service might need you to add a little code to your web pages, or integrate it in your web analytics tool, so it can start collecting a list of people from your website who match this criteria.
                Again, this won’t be a list of individual people with any personal information, such as names or email addresses. Instead, it’s an anonymous list (often called a retargeting list) of users that match your criteria who can be retargeted with ads.
                So, now that you’ve defined an audience, any visitor who started to subscribe but didn’t finish will be added to the list.
            </p>

            <p>
                 Now it’s time to create ads specifically for them
                Once they’ve subscribed, there’s no need to show them ads with subscription incentives anymore. So you might want to create a new retargeting list for current subscribers. Then, you can target them with a different ad campaign,
                perhaps convincing them to come back and explore all the other offers! So that’s how retargeting works. It tracks what people do on your website and then creates an audience based on their actions, letting advertisers design specific ads for people who have - or haven’t - done specific things

                <h2>search engine marketing (SEM)</h2>
               
                <p>
                SEM, is when businesses pay to advertise to people searching for  <span>specific keywords</span>   online.
                Every time someone searches advertisers compete for the opportunity to display ads. It happens in milliseconds and the searcher won’t see the details, only the winners: the ads that appear on the page.<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                So, how do search engines decide who wins? <br>
                The primary components are the bid and the quality.
                <SPAN>The bid</SPAN> is the maximum amount an advertiser is willing to pay for a click on an ad. If someone clicks the ad, the advertiser is charged an amount equal to—or sometimes less than—the bid.
                So, if an advertiser bids £2 for a keyword, that’s the most they would pay for a single ad click. If an ad shows on the page but no one clicks, it doesn’t cost the advertiser anything at all.
                Bids are important, but so is quality.
                </p>

                <p>
                <SPAN>Quality Score</SPAN>
                A measure from 1 to 10 of how relevant your ads and landing pages are to the keywords you’re bidding on. Improving your Quality Score can help you achieve better ad positions and lower prices for clicks. You can find your Quality Score in your keywords' "Status" column in your Google Ads account .<BR>
                    Your Quality Score combined with your bid amount creates your Ad Rank — the position your ad will appear in the search results page.

                In search engine marketing (SEM), you pay every time someone clicks on your ad. So naturally you want to make sure you’re getting your money’s worth.<br>
                there are three important factors to consider when choosing keywords. These are relevance, traffic and competition.

                            However, the cost of your specific Google Ad varies on a number of factors. Those factors include the quality of your website and how much you’re bidding.

                            As such, the cost is going to vary from ad to ad.

                            To understand how much Google advertising is going to cost your business, you need to first understand the Ad Auction system.

                        <h2>google ads</h2>

                       
                     
                <p>
                  Display advertising gives businesses the chance to pay for their ads to appear when the right kind of person is on the right kind of page.
                  There are lots of ways to do this. You can make deals directly with the owners of a website, or you can use networks that match businesses 
                  like Google Display Network or Yahoo, and they all offer different features, but there’s a few things most all of them have in common.
                  Websites that offer these ad spaces can become a part of these networks, and they can do things like set minimum prices for how much money they expect for showing ads.
                  Your business can then bid for the spots you want throughout all the websites in that network, deciding how much you’re willing to pay. Buyers and sellers are connected
                   every single time pages are loaded, and the ads that win the right to fill the ad spot are shown.
                  Of course, each network has its own rules, its own features and its own processes and bidding systems, but the key is that they all match buyers and sellers to fill available ad spots.
                </p>

              

                <p>
                 Networks can also help you target specific audiences through two main routes: <SPAN>the topics of the web pages where the ads appear, and general information about the people viewing the content.</SPAN>
                  While the exact criteria you can use to find your audience, or the way you actually go about running your campaign, could vary from network to network,
                targeting is essential to get your ads in front of the right people.
                </p>
                 <p>
                 Another thing networks do is handle the money involved. Buying and selling ads happens every second of every day, and the networks collect money from businesses and pay the websites that show the ads.
                  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, advertising networks collect and share data with businesses.
                 <SPAN>They can tell you how many times your ads are shown, how many times they’re clicked on, how much they cost you, where they’ve been showing up, and how all of this varies between the websites and audiences you’re targeting.</SPAN> Many networks even let you add tracking to your web pages so you can see
                 if your ads are resulting in conversions on your website. If you want to use display advertising to promote your business across the web, advertising networks are a great place to start. They’ll bring you together with the websites that want to sell you ad space. They’ll let you decide where your ads will be seen, and who will see them. They’ll manage the money for everyone involved. They’ll even provide you the data you need to know just how well your campaign is getting on.
                
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some benefits of using the Display Network is its reach. Google partners with more than two million websites and reaches more than 90% of all Internet users to help ensure your ad gets in front of the most eyes as possible.
    
                    The ads themselves are also flexible in terms of style. Your ad can be a gif, text, a video, or image.
