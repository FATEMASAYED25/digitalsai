    <h2>1/ content planning</h2>
    <p>
    The words you use should be so much more than just a sales pitch. In most cases you want to avoid phrases about how great you are.
    Instead, explain how you can meet the needs of your customer or solve a problem they have. By framing it in terms of what you can do to help customers,
    your content will be much more engaging, not to mention more helpful, explain concepts in everyday language.
    </p>

    <h4>1/list marketing objective:</h4>
    <p>

    <SPAN>S...specific</SPAN> : not a general objectives like "increase sales". specific objectives like selling 200 piece from new collection.<br>
    <SPAN>M...measureable</SPAN> : A quan­ti­ta­tive mea­sure might be​“200 piece from new collection ”<br>
    <SPAN>A...attainable</SPAN> : all objectives must make a progress and can acheive it  <br>
    <SPAN>R...realistic</SPAN> : not unusual like sell all inventory withen 2 dayes it is far from realistice and it will not achieve  <br>
    <SPAN>T...time bound</SPAN> :objectives must have start and end date  <br>

            <p>
    You need to identify your Unique Selling Point (or USP) - this is what makes you stand out from your competition online. 
    and focus on it in your content and ads in all of your online channels
    Find out what makes you different by looking at businesses doing similar things, and work out what sets you apart.
    For example, if customer service is what sets you apart from your competition, this is your Unique Selling Point.
    Other things to consider while working on your USP are your strengths and weaknesses. To do this, use a SWOT analysis,
    which will help ensure business decisions are well informed. SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ask yourself:
        what is it we’re good at? These are your strengths
        what can we do better? These are your weaknesses
        how can we grow, change and improve? These are your opportunities
        what is happening or could happen, both internally and externally, that might affect us negatively? Those are the threats.
        Understanding what you want to achieve can help you make the right decisions at the right time.

    <ol>
        <li> apps typically provide a specific function that’s not as easily accomplished on a web browser.<br>
        They are often integrated with common smartphone features, like the camera or GPS,mapping and your phone number</li>
    <li>apps can send messages to a person’s mobile, even when they’re not using the app. These are called “push notifications”.<br>
    You could use them to send your customers reminders when the latest offers or products</li>
    <li>Your app could also power a new loyalty program. Your customers could use the app to earn points for every purchase </li>
    <li> the app might send her a special offer,and notification when your customers are near by your shop  </li>
    <li>your app can use their mobile’s GPS to share directions to the shop</li>
        <li>Simplified checkout on your app could allow customers to purchase your products in just a few clicks</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>4/content Analyzing</h2>
    <p>

        Let’s dive in: Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs, are quantifiable measurements used to focus attention on the metrics most important to meet business goals.
        They are also useful in helping a team understand how progress will be tracked and measured.
    </p>

    <p>
        CARLS owns a chain of fitness centres called ‘Fit Gym’. He needs to make sure that he has enough customers to keep the business growing.
    To do this, Carl wants to sign up at least 50 new members per gym a month. This would be his goal. To help achieve this goal, 
    Carl now needs to set KPIs that will measure the efforts his staff make towards meeting this target.<br>
    
    The sales team should: <br>
    KPI 1: reach out to 20 prospective customers per day. <br>
    KPI 2: respond to all online queries on social media and email within 15 minutes of receiving them during working hours.<br>
    KPI 3: renew or upsell 8 existing gym memberships per month.<br>
    Analysing results against these KPIs will accurately assess which employees meet the expected standard, and help identify who needs additional sales training.
    </p>
   
    <p>
    read more about <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/choosing-kpis" target="_blank">how do you know what your KPIs should be, and how do you measure them?</a> <br>
     KPIs should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound.
    By creating them this way, you can ensure they will be clear and achievable. Try creating your own KPIs and see if you can answer the following:
    </p>

    <p>
    1. Is this KPI specific enough? 2. Can it be measured? 3. Can employees attain this? 4. How relevant is it to the wider business objective? e.
    And lastly, when is it due to be delivered or carried out?
    </p>
    <p>
    A crucial part of any online plan is to measure what you’re doing and make sure it’s working. This is called ‘analytics,’ and it can show you
    how people are finding your website and social media pages<br>
    and what they do when they get there.
    For example, in your hair salon, you don’t just want people to find your homepage, you might want them to do lots of things like: watch your clever how-to videos,
    make appointments, get driving directions to your shop,<br>
    or actually buy something. Tracking what people do on your site can help you to understand what’s working and what’s not, so you can make changes and continually
    improve what you’re doing
    </p>
    <p>
    . A final point to mention: remember that the online world is constantly changing.
    New tools, technologies and tactics pop up pretty much daily. So a good plan combines the basic concepts that don’t change that often, <br>
    with forward-thinking to keep up with the latest and greatest.Similarly, when things change in your industry, make sure your online world is kept up to date.
    ask yourself:
    Are you offering the latest hot trends in hairstyling? If hair dyes become the next big thing, you can quickly update your adverts to show customers what you can do.
    </p>
    <p>
    so, how to get these analytics?
    every digital marketing channels have it's analytics tool such as facebook, twitter, youtube have their own analytics tools that show you how your content is performing<br> 
    for your web site 
    you can use <a href="advertising.html Google-Analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> to track how many people visit your website,whether a vsitor scrolled down<br>
    a blog post, played video, or clicked through gallery images.<br>
    are people who read your blog more likely to buy?<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    you can get even more detailed content engagement metrices by using third-party tools like<br>
    SAI tools help writers understand which a piece of content<br>
    get the most attention from a user and where the more engaged users come from they also examine <br>
    the time a user spends looking at the content rather than just the clicks <br>
    now that you have tools and data. now,what do you measure?<br>
    in general , you'll look to measure <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li> <i class="fas fa-chart-line  fa-2x" style="color:purple"></i> Traffic: how much traffic did a piece of content generate visitors to your website ?</li>
    <li> <i class="fas fa-user-clock  fa-2x" style="color:purple"></i> Engagement: how engaged your audience was thisdefined by the time a visitor spends on a page ?<br>
    and the number of pages visited. </li>
    <li> <i class="fas fa-share-alt   fa-2x" style="color:purple"></i> social shares: how many times a piece of content was shared ? </li>
        <li> <i class="fas fa-shopping-cart fa-2x" style="color:purple"></i> conversions: what content led to conversions audiences to leads or leads to customers</li>
    </ul>

    <p> 
    when evaluating these metrics you want to look for trends and build on those content pieces that are doing well. <br>
    Also,be sure to look for gaps sometimes the content need is the content you're missing<br>
    next use these insights and results to repeat the whole process but with changes to your content<br>
    from the message of content to the format to the distribution. 
    </p>
    <div class="analytics">
        <img src="../imgs/goole.jpg" alt="google-analytics">
        <img src="../imgs/facebook.png" alt="facebook-analytics">
        <img src="../imgs/twitter.png" alt="twitter-analytics">
    </div>
    <p> with <a href="advertising.html Google-Analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>  you can track whether your marketing activity helped you achieve your goal.<br>
    Since Google Analytics can use UTM codes to categorize the traffic that comes into your site from different sources and different campaigns,<br>
    you can use Google Analytics to assess the following:<br>

    which social platforms delivered traffic to my site and did that traffic convert to my goals?<br>
    which content/campaigns delivered traffic?<br>
    which content/campaigns in which social platforms delivered traffic?<br>
    This can give you a high level view on whether your investments in different platforms are paying off.<br>
    And, you get a high level sense of the pieces of content that helped most.</p>
    <p>
    While the different social media platforms have slightly unique metrics and terminology, <br>
    you will find that there are roughly 2 categories of metrics when it comes to content you shared in these platforms:</p>
    <p>
    1. Audience Reach<br>
    All platforms give you a number of views for a specific post. Your number of ‘followers’,<br>
    or people who follow what you have to say will have a big influence on the number of views for your specific pieces of content.<br>

    2. Audience Engagement (how many people interacted with your post)<br>
    Audience engagement can mean different things in different platforms, but engagement in social platforms relates to users interacting with your content.    <br>
    That interaction could be: liking your content, sharing (or reposting) your content or commenting on your content.
    </p>
    <p> 
    Note that each platform also provides insights on your audience, like their demographics and in some cases behavioral insights<br>
    (e.g. how much time is my audience typically on instagram?).<br>
    Snapchat currently does not have an insights platform. But, you can still get some insights on engagement on a post by post basis.<br>
