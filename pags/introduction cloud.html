                <p>international Business Machines (IBM), is a global technology company that provides hardware, software, cloud-based services and cognitive computing.

                    it was originally called Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. It would be renamed to IBM in 1924.
                    
                    Given that the company is over 100 years old it is no surprise that it has had to adjust to different technological trends throughout the decades.</p>

        on my personal feedpack to the introduction course it is easy to understand and it is explained professionaly
        the introduction course is diveded into seven modules (i will explain in detail all these modules later )
                            The minimum passing mark for the course is 70% with the following weights:
        50% - All Graded Quiz Questions 
        50% - The Final Exam
        Though Graded Quiz Questions and the Final Exam have a passing mark of 50% each, the only grade that matters is the overall grade for the course.
        Graded Quiz Questions have no time limit. You are encouraged to review the course material to find the answers as this counts for 50% of your mark.
        The final exam has a 1-hour time limit.
        Attempts are per question in both, the Review Questions and the Final Exam:
        One attempt - For True/False questions
        Two attempts - For any question other than True/False
        and after pssing the exame successfully you will take certification like that:

    <h3>what is the cloud computing ?</h3>
    <p>NIST defines cloud computing as a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access
        to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned
        and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
    </p>
        <p>This cloud computing is composed of five essential characteristics which are included in three service models.</p>
        <h3>cloud computing characteristics are :</h3>
        <div class="sorty"><img src="imgs/cloud computing charactarists.png"></div>

        <h3>cloud computing service models are:</h3>
        <p>Cloud computing allows us to utilize technology as a service, leveraging remote resources on-demand, on a pay-as-you-model. There are three main service models available on the cloud—Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).</p>
       
        <h3>cloud computing deployment models are:</h3>
        <p>  Deployment models indicate where the infrastructure resides, who owns and manages it, and how cloud resources and services are made available to users. There are three main deployment models available on the cloud—Public, Private, and Hybrid.</p>
       
        

    <h3>what about IBM cloud ?</h3>
    <p>The IBM cloud platform globally deployed across data centers around the world, combines platform as a service (PaaS) with infrastructure as a service (IaaS) to provide an integrated experience. The platform scales and supports both small development teams and organizations, and large enterprise businesses.

        The platform is built to support your needs whether it's working only in the public cloud or taking advantage of a multicloud deployment model. IBM Cloud offers a variety of services including Compute, Network, Storage, Management, Security, Databases, Analytics, AI and Cloud Paks.</p>

            <p>Bitly has journeyed
                from a startup that offered intelligent link-shortening technology adopted by users to compress lengthy
                URLs for social media posts, to an enterprise product.
                Seeking an agile, cost-effective IT infrastructure to support this transition, Bitly started
                planning for cloud migration.
                Their need was to have a cloud-based model with pay-as-you-go pricing, the ability to
                scale up and scale down, a more global presence, and the ability to geodistribute into more
                POPs.
                And they wanted it to be low-risk.
                Bitly migrated to an IBM Cloud environment, establishing a scalable hosting platform for
                low-latency delivery to enterprise customers around the world.
                The results: 25 billion data-infused links migrated from
                one hosting site to Cloud infrastructure with data center locations worldwide.

                As its client base grew, ActivTrades wanted to cut latency, accelerate execution, and
                streamline the delivery of new functions.
                ActivTrades migrated three major trading systems from on-premises infrastructure to IBM Cloud
                for VMware solutions, backed by data storage, networking, and security offerings on the

                view only those transactions that are relevant to them. The more open, diverse,
                and distributed the network, the stronger the trust and transparency in the data
                and transactions. 85% of businesses today rely on multiple clouds to meet their IT</p>

                <h3>cloud computing service models are:</h3>
                <p>Cloud computing allows us to utilize technology as a service, leveraging remote resources on-demand, on a pay-as-you-model. There are three main service models available on the cloud—Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).</p>
                <div class="sorty"><img src="imgs/cloud computing services.png"></div>
                <h3>cloud computing deployment models are:</h3>
                <p>  Deployment models indicate where the infrastructure resides, who owns and manages it, and how cloud resources and services are made available to users. There are three main deployment models available on the cloud—Public, Private, and Hybrid.</p>

               <h2 id="module-four"> Module 4 - Components of Cloud Computing</h2>
               <div class="sorty"><img src="imgs/cloud component.png"></div>
                    <p>A cloud Data center is a huge room or a warehouse containing cloud infrastructure.
                        These data centers contain pods and racks or standardized containers of computing resources
                        such as servers, as well as storage, and networking equipment 
                        Computing Resources: Cloud providers offer several compute options
                       – Virtual Servers, Bare Metal Servers, and “Serverless” computing resources.
                      </p>

                      <h3>virtual servers (VMs)</h3>
                      <p>What makes a VM or Vs? A VM is simply a software-based computer. They're run like
                        a physical computer. They have an operating system and applications, and
                        they're completely independent of one another, but you can run multiple of them
                        on a hypervisor. And the hypervisor manages the resources that are allocated
                        to these virtual environments from the physical server. Because they're
                        independent you can run different operating systems on different virtual
                        machines. You could run Windows here, or Linux here, or UNIX here for example.
                        
                         So once you have your
                        hypervisor installed, you can build virtual environments, or virtual machines,
                        What a hypervisor is, it's simply a piece of
                        software that runs above the physical server, or host.they do is essentially pull the
                        resources from the physical server and allocate them to your virtual
                        examples would be VMware, ESXi, or Microsoft Hyper-v, or even open-source, or Oracle, VirtualBox
                        </p>

                        <h3>metal servers</h3>
                        <p>it's dedicated
                            to a single customer.
                            The cloud provider actually takes the physical server and plugs it into a rack in a data
                            center for customers. The cloud provider manages the server up to the operating system (OS),
                            which means if anything goes wrong with the hardware or rack connection, they will fix
                            or replace it and then reboot the server. The customer is responsible for administering
                            and managing everything else on the server.
                            Bare metal servers are either preconfigured by the cloud provider to meet workload packages
                            or they can be custom-configured as per customer specifications. This includes the processors,
                            RAM, hard drives, specialized components, and the OS. Customers can also install their
                            own OS and can install certain hypervisors that aren't available from the cloud provider,
                            and thus create their own virtual machines and farms. With bare metal servers you can
                            also add GPUs, which are designed for accelerating scientific computation, data analytics</p>
                            <h3>serverless or networking</h3>
                            <p>The main difference stems from the fact, that in the cloud, we use logical instances of
                                networking elements as opposed to physical devices.
                                To create a network in the cloud, one starts by defining the size of the network, or the
                                IP address range that establishes the boundaries or the cloud network.
                                Cloud networks are deployed in networking spaces that are logically separated segments
                                of the networks using options, including Virtual private Cloud (VPC) that in turn can be divided
                                into smaller segments called subnets.
                                Logically segmented cloud networks are private carveout of the cloud that offer customers
                                the security of private clouds and the scalability of public clouds.
                                Cloud resources, such as VMs or Virtual Server Instances (VSIs), Storage, network connectivity
                                and load balancers are deployed into subnets.
                                Using subnets allows users to deploy enterprise applications using the same multi-tier concepts
                                used in on-premises environments.
                                Subnets are also the main area where security is implemented in the cloud.
                                Every subnet is protected by Access Control Lists (ACLS) that serve as a subnet-level fire wall.
                                Within the subnet, one could create Security Groups that provide security at the instance level such as VSIs.
                                Once you build a subnet, then it is time to add some VSIs and storage
                            </p>

                            <h3>serverless computing</h3>
                            <p>The serverless model requires no provisioning of servers, installation of application stacks
                                and software, or operation of the infrastructure by the developer.
                                Serverless computing runs code only on-demand on a per-request basis, scaling transparently
                                with the number of requests being served.
                                Serverless enables end users to pay only for resources being used, never paying for idle
                                capacity, which is unlike virtual servers on the cloud—where end users pay for VMs
                                as long as they are running even if idle.
                                Effectively, serverless abstracts the infrastructure away from developers.
                                Code is executed as individual functions where each function runs inside a stateless container.
                                No prior execution context is required to serve a request; and with each new request,
                                a new instance of the function is invoked.</p>

                <h2 id="module-five"> Module 5 - Cloud Computing Storage and Content Delivery Networks</h2>
                <h3>Cloud Computing Storage</h3>
                <p>Cloud storage is where you save data and files in the cloud.
                    Certain storage must be attached to a compute node before the storage can be accessed, whereas
                    other storage types can be directly accessed either through the public Internet or a dedicated
                    private network connection.
                    Cloud providers host, secure, manage, and maintain the cloud storage and associated
                    infrastructure to ensure you have access to your data when you need it.
                    Cloud storage services allow you to scale your capacity as you need so you only pay
                    for what you provision, usually on a ‘per gigabyte’ basis.
                    The cost of storage will vary by type but in general, the faster the read / write speed
                    of the storage, the higher the per gigabyte cost.there are the four main types of cloud storage - Direct Attached, File, Block, and Object Storage</p>

                    <div class="sorty"><img src="imgs/cloud storage types.png"></div>

                    <h3>Content Delivery Networks</h3>
                    <p>A content delivery network, or CDN, is a
                        distributed server network that delivers
                        temporarily stored, or cached, copies of
                        website content to users, based on the
                        user's geographic location. A CDN stores
                        this content in distributed locations
                        and reduces the distance between your
                        website visitors, and your website server.</p>

                <p>●       Hybrid Multicloud is a cloud adoption strategy that makes it possible for public clouds, private clouds, and on-premises IT to interoperate seamlessly while leveraging the best cloud-based services from different public cloud providers.
                    the key elements of a hybrid Multicloud strategy are
                    Connects an organization’s on-premise private cloud and third-party public cloud into a single infrastructure 

                    <br>●       Microservices architecture is an approach in which an application is built as a collection of loosely coupled and independently deployable components or services, leading to efficient development, maintenance, and upgradation cycles.
                    
                   <br> ●       Serverless Computing is an approach to computing that offloads responsibility for common infrastructure management tasks for application runtimes to cloud providers, allowing developers to focus their time and effort on development and testing, and not have to worry about provisioning, maintaining and scaling compute resources.
                    
                   <br> ●       Cloud native applications are applications that are built or refactored to work in the cloud environment. These applications, developed using DevOps methodologies, consist of microservices packaged in containers that can run in any environment—making it possible to create and update features in quick iterative cycles.
                    
                    <br>●       DevOps is a collaborative approach that enables development and operations teams to continuously deliver software in quick iterative cycles while reducing overhead, duplication, and rework. DevOps’ tools, practices, and processes help tackle the complexities and challenges posed by the cloud, allowing solutions to be delivered and updated —quickly and reliably.
                    
                    <br>●       Application Modernization helps organizations accelerate their digital transformation, take advantage of new technologies and services, and become more responsive to changing market dynamics. Cloud computing is one of the key enablers of application modernization.
